# Assignment 1 Description

### Ackerman's function

Because the function is already a recursive form, we can simply apply this function with the recursion and get the final answer from the input m, n

### Powerset

I use a getline to get the input from keyborad and cut the whole input into elements, then use bits vector to record which elements should exist in the subset. Put the complete subset into result vector and sort the vector to make sure that the subsets had been listed from empty set
